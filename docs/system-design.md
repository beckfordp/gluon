# System Design — v1

Derived from [`user-stories.md`](./user-stories.md). Revise as it firms up.
Diagrams: [`diagrams/order-fulfillment-topology.svg`](./diagrams/order-fulfillment-topology.svg),
[`diagrams/environment-pipeline.svg`](./diagrams/environment-pipeline.svg) — vector,
open in a browser or Preview to zoom. Regenerate/update if this doc's shape changes
materially (they'll drift silently otherwise).

All six services below are generated fresh via `pure-service-generator` into
[`krypton/`](../README.md) — see [`../PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) for the phased
execution order — `purerest`'s own `order-service`/`inventory-service` are
library test fixtures only and are not reused.

## Services

| Service | Status | Store | Redis | Kafka |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| catalog-service | new (generator) | Postgres | read-through cache | — |
| cart-service | new (generator scaffold, reworked to Redis-native — no Postgres) | Redis only | primary store | — |
| order-service | new (generator) | Postgres | — | publishes `OrderCreated`, `OrderStatusChanged`; consumes `StockReserved`/`StockReservationFailed` |
| inventory-service | new (generator) | Postgres | — | publishes `StockReserved`/`StockReservationFailed` |
| payment-service | new (generator) | Postgres | idempotency keys | consumes `OrderCreated`; publishes `PaymentSettled`/`PaymentFailed` |
| notification-service | new (generator, no DB module) | — | — | consumer only |

## Sync vs. async boundaries
- **Sync (HTTP, resilience middleware):** checkout → order-service → reserve
  call → inventory-service. Needs a fast yes/no to show the customer.
- **Async (Kafka):** everything downstream of "order created" — reservation
  outcome, payment, notification. None of these block the customer-facing
  request.

## Kafka topics (draft)
- `order.created`
- `order.status-changed`
- `inventory.stock-reserved`
- `inventory.stock-reservation-failed`
- `payment.settled`
- `payment.failed`

One topic per event type for now; revisit compaction/partitioning key once
payment-service and notification-service exist. Schema/contract management:
see [ADR 0003](./adr/0003-kafka-schema-registry.md) (schema registry).

## Environments
minikube-successor (OrbStack, see [ADR 0002](./adr/0002-local-k8s-orbstack-over-minikube.md))
→ dev → staging → prod (EKS).

- Candidate release = container image tag, promoted through each environment
  via CI (GitHub Actions — already the pattern in `purerest` and
  `pure-service-generator`).
- Same k8s manifests/Helm charts parameterized per environment.
- Promotion gates: automated smoke tests per environment, following the
  existing `purerest/scripts/verify-observability-stack.sh` pattern (bring env
  up, assert against each system's own API, not just "container started").
- Kafka/Redis/Postgres: containers in local/dev, managed AWS equivalents in
  staging/prod (MSK / ElastiCache / RDS) — to be confirmed via ADR when we get
  there, not assumed here.
- AWS account boundary: single account, per-environment namespaces — see
  [ADR 0004](./adr/0004-single-aws-account-multi-namespace.md).

## Service discovery & ports
Every generated service defaults to port 8080, but it's already externalized
per-service via PureConfig (`port = 8080` overridden by
`${?<DOMAIN_NAME>_SERVICE_PORT}` in `application.conf`) — no generator change
needed to run two locally at once. In k8s, no bespoke service locator is
needed either: each pod's 8080 is isolated in its own network namespace, and
the k8s Service object + cluster DNS (`order-service.default.svc.cluster.local`)
already is the locator, independent of whatever port the container listens on
internally.

## UI prototype
A clickable React prototype (mock data, no backend) walks all eight user
stories — published as a Claude Artifact ("Order Fulfillment Topology"'s
sibling piece, "Krypton Storefront"), source kept at
[`prototype/storefront.html`](../prototype/storefront.html). Its mock service layer
(`catalogService`, `cartStore`, `orderService`-shaped logic, `inventoryService`,
`paymentService`, `notificationService`, plus a small pub/sub standing in for
Kafka) mirrors the six-service boundary and topic names above, so wiring it to
real APIs later is a per-module swap, not a rewrite. Not yet connected to any
real service — update this note once it is.

## Open design questions
None currently — see adr/ for decisions (0001-0004). Revisit this section as
new questions come up (e.g. serialization format/registry impl for ADR 0003,
MSK/ElastiCache/RDS confirmation ADR).
